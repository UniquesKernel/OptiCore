# Custom Language and CPU Emulator with Optional Optimization Platform

## Overview

This project involves creating a custom programming language and a CPU emulator capable of executing binaries compiled from this language. Additionally, it features an optional injection platform that performs runtime profiling and hot-swapping of optimized code segments. The system allows for flexible execution:

- **Standard Mode**: Run the emulator with minimal overhead using the raw binaries.
- **Optimized Mode**: Enable the injection platform for dynamic optimizations and improved performance.

## Goals

- **Learning Experience**: Deepen understanding of language design, compiler construction, CPU emulation, and dynamic code optimization.
- **Flexibility**: Provide a system that can run efficiently in both low-resource environments and high-performance scenarios.
- **Creativity**: Offer the freedom to experiment with language features, CPU architecture, and optimization techniques.

## Project Structure

- **Custom Language**: A simple language with its own syntax and compiler/assembler.
- **CPU Emulator**: Emulates a CPU that can execute binaries from the custom language.
- **Injection Platform**: An optional module that profiles and optimizes code at runtime.

## Getting Started

*(Instructions will be added as the project develops.)*

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Design the custom language and develop the compiler.
- **Phase 2**: Build the CPU emulator to execute the compiled binaries.
- **Phase 3**: Implement the optional injection platform for dynamic optimization.
- **Phase 4**: Integrate all components and conduct comprehensive testing.
- **Phase 5**: Document the project and expand features.
